# 🌐 Web Projects Collection (HTML & CSS Only)

Welcome to my collection of **web cloning projects**! This repository contains multiple **static webpage clones** created using **HTML** and **CSS only**, without any JavaScript. Each project demonstrates attention to layout, design accuracy, and responsive structuring based on the original web pages.

## 🚀 About
